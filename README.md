# The Sound Question — Website

Public website for **The Sound Question** at https://thesoundquestion.pages.dev/.

## Setup

- **Hosting:** Cloudflare Pages (free tier)
- **Deployment:** Automatic from the `main` branch of this GitHub repository
- **Framework:** Plain HTML and CSS, no build dependencies
- **Build output:** repository root (`.`)

## Pages

- `index.html` — homepage
- `about/index.html` — about
- `library/index.html` — public reference library landing page (not yet populated)
- `connect/index.html` — official account links
- `privacy/index.html` — website privacy notice
- `404.html` — not-found page

Shared styles are at `assets/styles.css`; the source-identifying graphic is `assets/mark.svg`.

## Important boundaries

The `thesoundquestion/research` repository is **private**. Nothing from it is automatically published here. Public studies, supporting files and source notes should only be copied to the website once explicitly reviewed and approved.

The site currently contains **no analytics scripts, third-party embeds, forms or advertising**. Please update the privacy notice if that changes.

## Updating

Edit and commit files to `main`. Cloudflare Pages should automatically deploy. If the build configuration is edited in Cloudflare, ensure that this plain HTML site continues to publish the repository root.

Use relative-to-root links (`/library/`, `/assets/styles.css`) so page paths work on all devices.
